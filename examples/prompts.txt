2. **Crypto transaction life-cycle (sequence diagram)**

4. **Git branching strategy (gitGraph)**

Show a gitGraph with a long-running *main* branch, feature branches *feat/auth* and *feat/ui-revamp* merging via pull requests, plus a hotfix branch off the last release tag.

5. **Hospital ERP data flow (C4 container diagram)**

Sketch a C4 level-2 container diagram of a hospital ERP: *Web Client*, *Mobile Client*, *API Gateway*, *Auth Service*, *Inventory Service*, *Billing Service*, all talking to a shared *PostgreSQL Cluster*—secure lines for sensitive data, dashed lines for public APIs.

6. **Algorithm decision tree (mindmap)**

Build a radial mind map called *Sorting Algorithms* with the root node splitting into *Comparison-based* and *Non-comparison-based*; under comparison-based add *QuickSort*, *MergeSort*, *HeapSort*; under non-comparison-based add *Radix*, *Counting*, *Bucket*.

7. **State machine for a to-do app (state diagram)**

Draw a state diagram with states: *Idle*, *Creating*, *Editing*, *Completed*, *Deleted*. Highlight transitions on hover and show an ‘Undo’ event looping back from *Deleted* to *Idle*.

8. **Distributed micro-frontends architecture (flowchart)**

Create a left-to-right flowchart titled *Micro-Frontends* showing three SPA fragments—*Navbar*, *Dashboard*, *Settings*—all loaded through a *Single-SPA Root* which fetches bundles from a *CDN* and shares a *Design System* library.

9. **DevOps CI/CD pipeline (timeline diagram)**

Render a timeline diagram with stages: *Commit* ➜ *GitHub Actions* ➜ *Unit Tests* ➜ *Docker Build* ➜ *Security Scan* ➜ *K8s Deploy*. Include optional parallel ‘Manual QA’ lane.

10. **Career-path roadmap (timeline / swim-lane)**
